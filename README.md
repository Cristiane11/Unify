##Where coders connect

An app created using ReactJS, MongoDB, Passport for Authentication

The basic idea of this app is to make the coders share their opinions and career related views, obstacles they face in the job.



Login/Signup uses Passport authentication, where user can signup or login and enter the app and post their views.
